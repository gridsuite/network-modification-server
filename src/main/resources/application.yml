# this structure is shared among all microservices, if you change it, change it everywhere.
# customQuery allows a microservice to set query parameters specific to itself.
# if customQuery is empty, set queryBegin to "?", otherwise set it to "&".
# this allow the user to add additional query elements common to all microservices
# and to use the appropriate leading character depending on whether the microsevice
# uses custom query parameters or not. customQueryBegin in this file must always be '?',
# it is present only to be able to be overriden by deployments in the
# manyschemas mode. It is used only for microservices that have predefined
# query parameters, and it must be used if customQuery is not empty, otherwise
# the manyschema mode doesn't work, so define it everywhere because it doesn't
# hurt.
